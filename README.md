__Project Description__:

- This project focuses on automating the process of analyzing student academic data and generating a professional report using Python. The system reads student marks from a CSV file, performs data analysis such as calculating total marks, average, grade, and result status, and visualizes the performance using graphs. Finally, the analyzed data and visualizations are exported into a formatted PDF report automatically.

- By using Python libraries like Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for data visualization, this project reduces manual effort and ensures accuracy in report generation. The generated PDF report can be easily shared with teachers, students, or management.

__Key Activities__:

- Reading student data from a CSV file.

- Cleaning the dataset (handling missing values).

- Calculating total marks and average.

- Assigning grades and pass/fail status.

- Visualizing student performance using graphs.

- Generating an automated PDF report.

__Tools & Technologies Used__:

- Python.

- Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation.

- Matplotlib – Data visualization.

- PdfPages / FPDF / ReportLab – PDF report generation.

- CSV file – Input data source.

__Advantages__:

- Saves time by automating report creation.

- Reduces manual calculation errors.

- Easy to modify and extend.

- Generates professional-looking reports.

- Useful for schools and educational institutions.

__Scope of the Project__:

- Can be extended to include more subjects.

- Can generate individual student reports.

- Can be connected to a database instead of CSV.

- Can include charts like pie charts and line graphs.

- Can be enhanced with a GUI or web interface.
